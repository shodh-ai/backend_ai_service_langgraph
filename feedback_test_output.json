Your response is a little <highlight text=\"too short\">too short</highlight> right now. We want to <highlight text=\"fully answer the question\">fully answer the question</highlight>. Remember our strategy: the 'Point-Example-Explanation' or P.E.E. structure. It helps us make sure we provide enough information. Let's break it down: First, you make your <highlight text=\"Point\">Point</highlight>. This is your main idea or answer to the question. Second, you give an <highlight text=\"Example\">Example</highlight> to support your point. Third, you give a short <highlight text=\"Explanation\">Explanation</highlight> of how your example proves your point. For example, if the question was 'What is your favorite animal?', a short answer would be 'My favorite animal is a cat.' This is your <highlight text=\"Point\">Point</highlight>. Then, you can add an <highlight text=\"Example\">Example</highlight>: 'For example, I have a cat named Whiskers at home.' And finally, an <highlight text=\"Explanation\">Explanation</highlight>: 'Whiskers is very playful and makes me happy, so I love cats.' See how this gives more detail? Your original response was good, but it was just the 'Point' part. Now, let's try to add the 'Example' and 'Explanation' parts for your answer. What is one specific example you can think of related to your point? And how does that example make your point stronger? Don't worry, we'll practice this together. It's okay if it's not perfect yet. The most important thing is to try to add more information using this structure. You're doing great, Harshit!"

      "Proficiency": "Beginner",
      "Behavior Factor": "Overconfidence",
      "Error": "Task Fulfillment",
      "Diagnose": "The student demonstrates a lack of task fulfillment, likely stemming from overconfidence and a failure to carefully analyze the prompt requirements. The student's beginner language level exacerbates the issue, leading to potential misunderstandings and incomplete responses.",
      "Prioritize": "Task fulfillment is paramount. Without addressing this, all other aspects of writing are irrelevant. We need to instill a habit of meticulous prompt analysis before any writing begins.",
      "Explain Strategy": "We will use a three-step process: 1) **Deconstruct the Prompt:** Break down the prompt into its core components. Identify the specific questions being asked and the required format. 2) **Outline:** Create a detailed outline that directly addresses each component of the prompt. This outline will serve as a roadmap for the response. 3) **Review and Revise:** After writing a draft, meticulously compare the response to the original prompt and the outline. Ensure that every aspect of the prompt has been fully addressed. I will emphasize that overconfidence is detrimental to this process and that careful planning is essential, regardless of perceived ability.",
      "Provide Example Feedback": "Your response only partially addresses the prompt. The prompt asked for X, Y, and Z. You only provided X and a brief mention of Y. There is no Z. Before writing, you MUST create an outline. For example: I. X (details), II. Y (details), III. Z (details). Then, write each section based on your outline. This ensures you answer everything. Overconfidence leads to missed requirements. Slow down, plan, and execute.",
      "Suggest Followup": "I will provide the student with a new, similar task and require them to submit their outline *before* writing the full response. This allows me to assess their understanding of the prompt and provide feedback on their planning process before they invest time in writing. I will also incorporate regular 'prompt analysis' exercises into future lessons.",
      "Consider Student State": "If the student was *confident*, I would emphasize the importance of precision and attention to detail, framing it as a way to elevate their already strong work. I would highlight examples of successful professionals who meticulously plan and prepare, regardless of their expertise. If the student was *frustrated*, I would acknowledge their frustration and reassure them that this is a common challenge for language learners. I would break down the task into even smaller, more manageable steps and provide more scaffolding and support. I would also emphasize the progress they have made so far and focus on building their confidence through small, achievable goals."

      "Prioritize": "I would prioritize task fulfillment first. Without addressing the core requirement of answering the question, grammatical accuracy and stylistic flourishes are irrelevant. Building confidence in addressing the prompt directly will also help alleviate some of the shyness by providing a clear framework for response.",

Third, we add 1-2 sentences to elaborate on the answer, providing more detail or context.

I would also create a safe and encouraging environment, emphasizing that mistakes are part of the learning process and that I am there to help them improve.",
      "Provide Example Feedback": "Okay, let's look at the task again. The question was [State the question]. Your response was [State the student's response].

Okay, now, what is a simple answer to that question? Don't worry about making it perfect, just give me a basic answer. [Wait for response, provide a simple sentence starter if needed, e.g., 'The answer is...']. Good. Now, can you add one more sentence to explain that a little more? [Again, provide support and encouragement]. See? You answered the question! We can work on making it sound better later, but the most important thing is that you understood the question and gave a clear answer.",
      "Suggest Followup": "My next step would be to provide several similar writing prompts and work through the 'Question-Answer-Elaborate' template with the student, providing scaffolding and positive reinforcement at each step. I would also incorporate opportunities for the student to practice speaking their answers aloud, starting with one-on-one interactions and gradually introducing small group activities to help overcome their shyness. I would also provide written examples of model answers using the template.",

Then, I'd introduce a simple framework for approaching speaking tasks: 1) Understand the question: What is it asking me to do? 2) Plan your response: What are the main points I want to make? (Even just a few words as notes). 3) Speak clearly and slowly: Focus on being understood, not on being perfect. 4) Don't be afraid to pause: It's okay to take a moment to think. For task fulfillment, I'd emphasize the importance of directly answering the question and providing relevant details. We'd practice breaking down prompts into smaller parts and identifying key information.",
      "Provide Example Feedback": "Okay, I noticed you seemed a little nervous, which is totally understandable! Let's try this again. Remember, it's okay to take your time. For this question, it was asking about your favorite hobby. You mentioned you like sports, which is great! But can you tell me *which* sport is your favorite and *why*? Just a simple sentence or two. For example, you could say, 'My favorite sport is soccer because I like running and playing with my friends.' See? Simple and direct.",

      "Provide Example Feedback": "Okay, let's look at your response. The question was 'What is your favorite color?' You said 'Blue.' That's a start, but it's not enough. We need to use the P.E.E. structure. Point: 'My favorite color is blue.' Example: 'For example, the sky is blue.' Explanation: 'The blue sky makes me feel calm and happy, so blue is my favorite.' See how we have a point, an example, and an explanation? Now, let's try another question together, using this structure.",

      "Suggest Followup": "In the next session, I would review the same task with a slightly different prompt, focusing on building confidence and reinforcing the template. I would also incorporate more visual aids and real-life examples to make the task more accessible. I would continue to provide positive reinforcement and encouragement, emphasizing effort over perfection.",
      "Consider Student State": "If the student was frustrated, I would acknowledge their feelings and reassure them that it's okay to struggle. I would offer to simplify the task further or provide more direct assistance. If the student was confident, I would encourage them to elaborate on their responses and experiment with more complex sentence structures, while still adhering to the basic template."
