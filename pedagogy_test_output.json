    "task_suggestion_tts": "Based on your current assessment, I've designed a comprehensive learning plan for you to prepare for the TOEFL. We'll start with building a strong foundation in grammar and vocabulary, then gradually move into developing your reading, listening, speaking, and writing skills, culminating in specific TOEFL test strategies. How does that sound as a starting point?",
    "reasoning": "Given that the student's initial assessment shows all fields as 'None', this indicates a need for a comprehensive and foundational pedagogy. The plan assumes no prior specific strengths or weaknesses have been identified, thus necessitating a broad approach that builds from the ground up. The order prioritizes fundamental language skills (grammar, vocabulary) as they underpin all other proficiencies. It then progresses systematically through individual language skills (listening, reading, speaking, writing), starting with basic concepts and moving towards more complex and academic contexts. Finally, it integrates test-specific strategies and practice tasks to ensure the student is well-prepared for the TOEFL format and demands. Varied topics are included throughout to prevent comfort or discomfort zones, simulating the unpredictable nature of the actual TOEFL exam. The pedagogy utilizes a mix of teaching, scaffolding, modeling, cowriting, and testing to provide diverse learning experiences and continuous assessment.",
