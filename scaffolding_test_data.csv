To combat those 'ums' and 'uhs,' we'll use a structured template. This isn't about memorization, but about having a clear roadmap for your response. I call it the Opinion-Reason-Example template. It's simple, logical, and effective. I'll provide you with the template now.","Before you start speaking, take a few seconds to jot down keywords for each section of the template. Focus on the *content* of your ideas, not on perfect grammar at this stage. Use the sentence starters provided to launch each section. This will give you a confident start and maintain momentum. Remember, clarity and logical flow are key.","I will listen carefully to the student's response, noting where they adhere to the template and where they deviate. If they still struggle with filler words, I will interrupt briefly to redirect them back to the template ('Remember your sentence starter for the next reason'). If they use the template effectively, I will provide positive reinforcement and move on to practicing with different prompts.","In the next iteration, I will provide a *partially* completed template, removing some of the sentence starters or the 'Example' prompts. The goal is to gradually reduce the reliance on the explicit structure, encouraging the student to internalize the logical flow and generate their own transitions.","Given the student's 'okay' attitude and desire for support, I will present the template as a helpful tool, not a rigid constraint. My tone will be direct but encouraging, emphasizing the benefits of structure for reducing anxiety and improving fluency. I will avoid overly critical language and focus on positive reinforcement for effort and improvement."

If you still hesitate, I'll gently prompt you with the next section of the template (e.g., 'Okay, now give me an example for that reason.').

This will encourage the student to recall the structure independently while still providing some support.","Given the student's 'okay' attitude and beginner comfort level, I'll present the template in a very straightforward and non-intimidating manner. I'll emphasize that it's a tool to *help* them, not a rigid rule to follow. I'll also offer positive reinforcement for any effort to use the template, even if the execution isn't perfect initially."
