    "Proficiency": "Beginner",
    "Behavior Factor": "Frustration",
    "Error": "Grammar (tense, S-V agreement, articles)",
    "Diagnose": "The student is making grammatical errors (tense, subject-verb agreement, articles) and shows signs of frustration, likely stemming from these errors and the difficulty of communicating effectively at a beginner level.",
    "Prioritize": "Address subject-verb agreement first. It's a foundational element of sentence construction and relatively straightforward to grasp with focused instruction. Correcting this will immediately improve clarity and reduce the feeling of making basic mistakes.",
    "Explain Strategy": "I would explain subject-verb agreement using a simple template: 'Singular subject + singular verb' and 'Plural subject + plural verb.' I'd use visual aids like a table with 'Subject' and 'Verb' columns. I'd then provide examples and ask the student to identify the subject and verb in each, then correct any errors. I'd emphasize that this is a fundamental rule and mastering it will significantly improve their English.",
    "Provide Example Feedback": "Okay, let's look at this sentence: 'He go to the store.' The subject is 'He,' which is singular. So, the verb needs to be singular too. Instead of 'go,' we need 'goes.' So, the correct sentence is: 'He goes to the store.' See how the 's' on 'goes' matches the singular 'He'? Let's try another one.",
    "Suggest Followup": "After the initial correction and explanation, I would provide a worksheet with fill-in-the-blank exercises focusing solely on subject-verb agreement. I would then review the worksheet together, providing immediate feedback and reinforcing the rule. I would also encourage the student to practice speaking using simple sentences with correct subject-verb agreement.",
    "Consider Student State": "Given the student's frustration, I would emphasize progress and effort over perfection. I would use positive reinforcement, highlighting correct usage and improvements. I would break down the concept into smaller, manageable steps and avoid overwhelming the student with too much information at once. I would also offer encouragement and reassurance that mistakes are a normal part of the learning process and that with practice, they will improve."

    "Prioritize": "I would prioritize addressing subject-verb agreement first. It's a foundational element of sentence construction, and mastering it can provide a quick win, boosting confidence and providing a solid base for tackling more complex grammatical concepts. Correct article usage is important, but less crucial for basic communication at this stage.",
    "Explain Strategy": "I would explain subject-verb agreement using a simple template: \"Singular subject + singular verb (usually ends in -s). Plural subject + plural verb (no -s).\" I'd use visual aids like a table with 'Singular' and 'Plural' columns, listing common subjects and their corresponding verb forms (e.g., 'I am,' 'He is,' 'They are'). I'd then provide fill-in-the-blank exercises with clear examples, starting with very simple sentences and gradually increasing complexity. I would emphasize repetition and positive reinforcement for correct answers.",
    "Provide Example Feedback": "Okay, let's look at this sentence: 'He go to the store.' The subject is 'He,' which is singular. Remember our rule: singular subject needs a singular verb, usually ending in -s. So, we need to change 'go' to 'goes.' The correct sentence is: 'He goes to the store.' Let's try another one.",
    "Suggest Followup": "After the initial intervention, I would assign a short, focused practice activity on subject-verb agreement. This could be a worksheet with fill-in-the-blanks or a simple sentence-building exercise. I would provide immediate feedback and encouragement.

    "Prioritize": "I would prioritize subject-verb agreement first. It's a foundational element of sentence construction, and mastering it will provide a solid base for addressing more complex grammatical issues. Addressing the overconfidence is also crucial, but indirectly, by demonstrating the importance of accuracy.",
    "Explain Strategy": "I would explain subject-verb agreement using a simple template: 'Singular subject + singular verb' and 'Plural subject + plural verb.' I'd use visual aids like charts or diagrams to illustrate the concept. I'd then provide several examples and ask the student to identify the subject and verb in each sentence, then correct any errors. I would emphasize the importance of slowing down and consciously checking each sentence for agreement. I would also introduce the concept of 'dummy subjects' like 'there is/are' and how they affect verb agreement.",
    "Provide Example Feedback": "Okay, let's look at this sentence: 'He go to the store yesterday.' The subject is 'He,' which is singular. The verb should agree with 'He.' Also, 'yesterday' indicates past tense. So, the correct sentence is: 'He went to the store yesterday.' Notice how 'He' (singular) requires 'went' (past tense, singular form). Now, let's try another one.",
    "Suggest Followup": "I would assign a series of exercises focusing solely on subject-verb agreement in simple sentences. I would also encourage the student to read simple texts and identify examples of correct subject-verb agreement.

    "Error": "Grammar (tense, S-V agreement, articles)",
    "Diagnose": "The student is exhibiting errors in basic grammar (tense, subject-verb agreement, articles) and displays signs of nervousness during speaking tasks. The grammatical errors suggest a lack of foundational understanding, while the nervousness likely exacerbates these errors and hinders fluency.",
    "Prioritize": "I would prioritize addressing the grammatical errors first, specifically focusing on subject-verb agreement and basic tense usage (present simple, past simple). A solid grammatical foundation is crucial for building confidence and reducing anxiety related to speaking. Addressing nervousness directly without grammatical competence will likely be ineffective.",
    "Explain Strategy": "I would use a structured, repetitive approach to teach subject-verb agreement and basic tenses. This involves: 1) Explicitly explaining the rules with simple examples. 2) Providing a template for sentence construction. 3) Engaging in controlled practice exercises with immediate feedback. 4) Gradually increasing the complexity of the sentences. For nervousness, I would create a low-pressure environment, emphasize that mistakes are part of the learning process, and encourage slow, deliberate speech. I would also incorporate short breathing exercises before speaking activities.",
    "Provide Example Feedback": "Okay, let's look at this sentence: 'I go to the store yesterday.' The word 'yesterday' tells us this happened in the past. So, we need to use the past tense. The past tense of 'go' is 'went.' Also, 'the store' is correct here. So, the correct sentence is: 'I went to the store yesterday.' Let's try another one. Remember, past tense needs a past tense verb. Now, repeat after me: 'I went to the store yesterday.' Good. Now, tell me, 'Yesterday, you...?' (pause for student response, guiding them to say 'went to the store').",
    "Suggest Followup": "The next step would be to provide more controlled practice exercises focusing on subject-verb agreement and past tense usage. I would use fill-in-the-blank exercises, sentence completion tasks, and simple question-and-answer activities. I would also introduce a simple speaking template for describing past events, such as: 'Yesterday, I [verb in past tense] [object/place]. For example, 'Yesterday, I watched TV.' We will continue to practice this template until the student demonstrates consistent accuracy and increased confidence.",
    "Consider Student State": "If the student was *frustrated*, I would slow down the pace, break down the concepts into even smaller steps, and offer more positive reinforcement. I would emphasize progress, no matter how small. If the student was *confident*, I would gradually increase the complexity of the exercises and encourage more spontaneous speaking activities, while still providing structured feedback. I would also introduce new vocabulary related to the topics being discussed."

    "Prioritize": "I would address the most fundamental grammatical error first, likely subject-verb agreement, as it impacts clarity significantly. Addressing this foundational element will provide a solid base for future learning and boost confidence.",
    "Explain Strategy": "I would use a simple, repetitive template to reinforce correct subject-verb agreement. First, I'd explain the basic rule: singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. Then, I'd provide a fill-in-the-blank exercise with clear examples. I'd encourage the student to speak the sentences aloud, focusing on clear pronunciation and correct verb forms. I would emphasize that mistakes are a normal part of learning and create a safe space for practice. I would also use visual aids, like color-coding subjects and verbs, to reinforce the concept.",
    "Provide Example Feedback": "\"Okay, let's look at this sentence: 'He go to the store.' The subject is 'he,' which is singular. So, the verb needs to be singular too. We need to say 'He goes to the store.' Can you repeat that for me? 'He goes to the store.' Good. Now, let's try another one: 'They eat pizza.' Is 'they' singular or plural? Plural. So, 'eat' is correct. Now, you try: 'The dog ____ (eat) the bone.' What goes in the blank?\"",
    "Suggest Followup": "I would assign a short, structured writing exercise focusing solely on subject-verb agreement. I would also incorporate pair work where the student can practice speaking with a classmate in a low-pressure environment, using simple sentence structures and focusing on correct grammar.

    "Explain Strategy": "I would explain subject-verb agreement using a simple template: \"Singular subject + singular verb (usually ends in -s). Plural subject + plural verb (no -s).\" I'd use visual aids like color-coding subjects and verbs in example sentences. I'd also incorporate short, repetitive drills focusing solely on identifying the correct verb form for a given subject. To address restlessness, I'd break the lesson into very short segments (2-3 minutes each) with brief movement breaks in between (e.g., stand up and stretch, touch your toes). I would also use active learning techniques, such as having the student physically manipulate cards with subjects and verbs to form correct sentences.",
    "Provide Example Feedback": "Okay, let's look at this sentence: 'He go to the store.' The subject is 'He,' which is singular. So, the verb needs to be singular too. Remember our rule: singular subject, verb usually ends in -s. So, it should be 'He goes to the store.' Let's try another one. What verb do we use with 'They'? 'They goes' or 'They go'?",
    "Suggest Followup": "My next step would be to provide the student with a worksheet containing simple sentences with blanks for the verb. The worksheet would be designed with plenty of white space and large font to minimize visual clutter and reduce potential for restlessness-induced errors. I would also incorporate a self-checking component, such as a key with the correct answers, to encourage independent learning and reduce reliance on constant teacher intervention.",
    "Consider Student State": "If the student was frustrated, I would immediately reduce the complexity of the task and offer positive reinforcement for any effort, regardless of accuracy. I would say something like, \"I see you're getting frustrated. Let's take a deep breath. We'll just focus on one thing at a time. Even trying is a success!\" If the student was confident, I would still maintain a structured approach but introduce slightly more challenging examples and encourage them to explain their reasoning behind their answers. I would also introduce a timer to see how many correct sentences they can make in a set amount of time, turning it into a game."

    "Prioritize": "I would prioritize subject-verb agreement first. It's a foundational element of sentence construction and directly impacts clarity. Correct tense usage is also important, but often relies on understanding subject-verb agreement. Article usage can be addressed after these two are more solid.",
    "Explain Strategy": "I would explain subject-verb agreement using a simple template: Singular subject + singular verb; Plural subject + plural verb. I'd use visual aids like a table to illustrate this. For tense, I'd focus on the present simple and past simple initially, again using a table to show the verb forms. For articles, I'd explain the difference between 'a,' 'an,' and 'the,' focusing on countable nouns and specific vs. general references. I'd use clear examples for each rule and encourage the student to create their own sentences using the templates.",
    "Provide Example Feedback": "Okay, let's look at this sentence: 'I go to the store yesterday.' The word 'yesterday' tells us this happened in the past. So, we need the past tense of 'go,' which is 'went.' Also, 'the store' implies a specific store. If you're talking about any store, you could say 'a store.' So, a better sentence would be: 'I went to the store yesterday.' Or, 'I went to a store yesterday.' Now, try another sentence about something you did yesterday, focusing on using the past tense correctly.",

    "Explain Strategy": "I would explain subject-verb agreement using a simple template and visual aids. First, I'd introduce the concept: 'The subject of a sentence must agree with the verb in number. Singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs.' Then, I'd present a template: 'Subject (singular) + Verb (singular - often ends in -s) = Correct. Subject (plural) + Verb (plural - no -s) = Correct.' I'd use color-coding to highlight the subject and verb in example sentences. I'd then provide practice exercises where the student identifies the subject and chooses the correct verb form. I would emphasize repetition and positive reinforcement for correct answers.",
    "Provide Example Feedback": "Original: 'He go to the store yesterday.' Feedback: 'Okay, let's look at this sentence. The subject is 'he,' which is singular. Because we're talking about yesterday (past tense), we need the past tense form of 'go,' which is 'went.' So, the correct sentence is: 'He went to the store yesterday.' Notice how 'he' is singular, and 'went' is the past tense form. Let's try another one.'",
    "Suggest Followup": "After addressing subject-verb agreement, I would move on to tense consistency, focusing on simple past, present, and future tenses.

I'd use simple examples and visual aids (like hand gestures to represent singular and plural) to reinforce the concept. Then, I'd break down the student's error, identifying the subject and verb and explaining why they don't agree. I'd use mirroring and repetition to practice the correct form, emphasizing the sound and feel of the correct agreement. To manage restlessness, I'd incorporate short, active exercises like clapping or tapping along with the syllables of the subject and verb.",
    "Provide Example Feedback": "Okay, let's look at this sentence: 'He go to the store yesterday.' The subject is 'he,' which is singular. So, the verb needs to be singular too. But because you said 'yesterday,' we know it's in the past. So, instead of 'go,' we need to say 'went.' Let's try it together. 'He' (clap once) 'went' (clap once) 'to' (clap once) 'the' (clap once) 'store' (clap once) 'yesterday' (clap three times). 'He went to the store yesterday.' Can you say it with me? Let's focus on making 'went' sound clear and strong.",
    "Suggest Followup": "I would provide the student with a worksheet containing simple sentences with blanks where they need to fill in the correct form of the verb, focusing on subject-verb agreement in the present and past tenses. I'd also incorporate short, interactive games or activities that require them to quickly identify and correct subject-verb agreement errors. I'd continue to monitor their speaking and provide immediate, positive reinforcement for correct usage.",
    "Consider Student State": "If the student was frustrated, I would slow down the pace, offer more encouragement, and break the task into even smaller, more manageable steps. I might also use humor or relatable examples to lighten the mood. If the student was confident, I would challenge them with more complex sentences and encourage them to explain the rules of subject-verb agreement to me, reinforcing their understanding."
