This helps you get your core ideas down before you even open your mouth, preventing you from going off-topic. Don't worry about perfect sentences, just keywords!\n2.  **During your response (Speaking Template):** As you begin speaking, use the 'Speaking Template' as your guide. Start with your opinion, then transition smoothly to your first reason and its example, then your second reason and its example, and finally, a brief conclusion.\n3.  **Boost your flow (Sentence Starters):** Feeling stuck for words? The 'Sentence Starters' are there to give you a helpful nudge! Pick one that fits the part of your response you're on (opinion, reason, example, conclusion) and let it help you get started.\n\n**Why this will help you:** This structured approach will directly address your primary struggle. By outlining your thoughts *before* speaking, you'll feel more prepared and less likely to ramble. The clear template gives you a predictable path, making it easier to stay organized under time pressure. The sentence starters reduce the mental effort of finding the right words, freeing you to focus on delivering your message confidently. You've got this, Harshit!"

This helps you get your core ideas down before you even open your mouth, preventing you from going off-topic. Don't worry about perfect sentences, just keywords!\n2.  **During your response (Speaking Template):** As you begin speaking, use the 'Speaking Template' as your guide. Start with your opinion, then transition smoothly to your first reason and its example, then your second reason and its example, and finally, a brief conclusion.\n3.  **Boost your flow (Sentence Starters):** Feeling stuck for words? The 'Sentence Starters' are there to give you a helpful nudge! Pick one that fits the part of your response you're on (opinion, reason, example, conclusion) and let it help you get started.\n\n**Why this will help you:** This structured approach will directly address your primary struggle. By outlining your thoughts *before* speaking, you'll feel more prepared and less likely to ramble. The clear template gives you a predictable path, making it easier to stay organized under time pressure. The sentence starters reduce the mental effort of finding the right words, freeing you to focus on delivering your message confidently. You've got this, Harshit!"
