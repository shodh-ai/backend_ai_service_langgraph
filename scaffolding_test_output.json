That's totally normal when you're starting out, and I'm here to help you turn that anxiety into confidence!\n\nI've created a special template just for you, focusing on the TOEFL Speaking Question 1 (Independent Task). This 'ORE' structure (Opinion, Reason, Example) is incredibly effective, and I've added friendly time cues to guide you. Think of these time cues not as strict deadlines, but as gentle nudges to keep you on track and help you pace yourself. With practice, you'll find that these guides become second nature, and your speaking will flow much more smoothly."

Don't worry about perfection; just try to fill in each section as prompted.\n2.  **Focus on the Flow:** Initially, concentrate on moving from one section to the next. Use the suggested phrases in the 'placeholder' fields to help you transition smoothly.\n3.  **Don't Overthink:** It's okay if your examples aren't perfect or your reasons aren't incredibly profound. The goal is to get comfortable with the structure and the timing.\n4.  **Listen to Yourself:** Record your practice responses and listen back. Notice where you might need a little more time or where you can condense your thoughts.\n\n### Applying it to Your Current Task:\nFor any TOEFL Speaking Question 1 task (like 'Do you agree or disagree with X?', or 'Which do you prefer, A or B?'), simply plug your ideas into this framework. For example, if the question is 'Do you prefer studying alone or with a group?', you would:\n*   **Intro:** State your preference clearly.\n*   **Reason 1 & Example 1:** Give your first reason why you prefer it, and back it up with a specific personal experience or observation.\n*   **Reason 2 & Example 2:** Add a second reason with another specific detail.\n*   **Conclusion:** Briefly restate your preference.\n\n### How This Helps with Your Struggle:\nThis template directly tackles your primary struggle with **organization and structure** by providing a clear, step-by-step roadmap for your response. The built-in time cues will empower you to manage your time effectively, directly addressing your **low confidence in speaking under time constraints**. By practicing with this framework, you'll gain the confidence that comes from knowing exactly how to structure your answer, even under pressure. You've got this, Harshit!"

That's totally normal when you're starting out, and I'm here to help you turn that anxiety into confidence!\n\nI've created a special template just for you, focusing on the TOEFL Speaking Question 1 (Independent Task). This 'ORE' structure (Opinion, Reason, Example) is incredibly effective, and I've added friendly time cues to guide you. Think of these time cues not as strict deadlines, but as gentle nudges to keep you on track and help you pace yourself. With practice, you'll find that these guides become second nature, and your speaking will flow much more smoothly."

        "content": "### How to Use This Template Effectively:\n1.  **Practice with a Timer:** Set a 45-second timer for your response, just like the actual TOEFL exam. Don't worry about perfection; just try to fill in each section as prompted.\n2.  **Focus on the Flow:** Initially, concentrate on moving from one section to the next. Use the suggested phrases in the 'placeholder' fields to help you transition smoothly.\n3.  **Don't Overthink:** It's okay if your examples aren't perfect or your reasons aren't incredibly profound. The goal is to get comfortable with the structure and the timing.\n4.  **Listen to Yourself:** Record your practice responses and listen back. Notice where you might need a little more time or where you can condense your thoughts.\n\n### Applying it to Your Current Task:\nFor any TOEFL Speaking Question 1 task (like 'Do you agree or disagree with X?', or 'Which do you prefer, A or B?'), simply plug your ideas into this framework. For example, if the question is 'Do you prefer studying alone or with a group?', you would:\n*   **Intro:** State your preference clearly.\n*   **Reason 1 & Example 1:** Give your first reason why you prefer it, and back it up with a specific personal experience or observation.\n*   **Reason 2 & Example 2:** Add a second reason with another specific detail.\n*   **Conclusion:** Briefly restate your preference.\n\n### How This Helps with Your Struggle:\nThis template directly tackles your primary struggle with **organization and structure** by providing a clear, step-by-step roadmap for your response. The built-in time cues will empower you to manage your time effectively, directly addressing your **low confidence in speaking under time constraints**. By practicing with this framework, you'll gain the confidence that comes from knowing exactly how to structure your answer, even under pressure. You've got this, Harshit!"
