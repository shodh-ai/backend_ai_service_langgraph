    "text_for_tts": "Let's start building your confidence in speaking English fluently!  This lesson focuses on a crucial skill for the TOEFL: constructing independent sentences. I understand that speaking a new language can sometimes feel a bit challenging, and it's perfectly normal to hesitate or search for the right words.  We'll work together at a comfortable pace, focusing on building your skills gradually.  Remember, progress is key, not perfection. Independent clauses are complete sentences that stand alone. They have a subject and a verb and express a complete thought.  Mastering them is fundamental for clear and effective communication in English.  We'll practice forming these sentences correctly and confidently. For instance: \"The cat sat on the mat.\" This is an independent clause because it has a subject (cat), a verb (sat), and expresses a complete thought.\n\n\"Although it was raining,\" this is NOT an independent clause; it's a dependent clause because it doesn't express a complete thought on its own. It needs another clause to complete the meaning, for example: \"Although it was raining, the children played outside.\" A common point of confusion is: A common misconception is confusing independent and dependent clauses.  Remember, an independent clause can stand alone, while a dependent clause cannot. To check your understanding: Can you give me an example of an independent clause, and then explain why it's independent? In this step, we learned to identify and construct independent clauses, a building block for fluent English speech.  This is a crucial foundation for improving your overall TOEFL speaking skills.",
